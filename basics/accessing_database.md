# Accessing your database

When you have a database, you can access and inspect if via different ways.

First, you can directly connect to your database with the `psql` command.

```shell
psql yourdatabasename
```

This will open an interactive session on the specified database, and let you
execute SQL commands on it.

Alternatively you can use database inspection tools, like TablePlus, datagrip,
your IDE, adminer. You can find instructions on the web for your tools.
