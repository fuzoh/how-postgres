# Indexes

Indexes are one of the most powerful features of a database system.
They allow many features like :
- Accelerating searches through your tables.
- Allowing to efficiently check uniqueness constraints.

There are many other benefits of indexes, but keep in mind one trade-off, indexes
need to be updated on each writes, thus, the write performances could be affected
on large indexes.

The next chapter will travel through the main indexes functionalities with postgres.
