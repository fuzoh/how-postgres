# Indexes

Indexes are one of the most powerful features of a database system.
They allow many features like :
- Accelerating searches through your tables.
- Allowing to efficiently check uniqueness constraints.

There are many other benefits of indexes, but keep in mind one trade-off, indexes
need to be updated on each writes, thus, the write performances could be affected
on large indexes.

The next chapter will travel through the main indexes functionalities with postgres.

## Basics

IImagine you create a database to store users. You have many users, let's say,
1 million. So you have a table users, and in this table you have an id and a name column.
Now, you want to search a user with the id 500'000. Your database will have
to walk through the 500'000 first elements to find the record.
This is a terrible performance bottleneck, imagine, each request to your database
will need to walk tons of records each time.

Indexes are a specific kind of data structure imagined to optimise search time
in a large amount of data. The index will allow the database to travel a table
extremely fast, and therefore accelerate your queries.

### Creating an index

You can use `CREATE INDEX` to generate a new index on an existing table.

````sql
CREATE TABLE my_table ( -- table creation
    my_field int
);

CREATE INDEX my_field_index ON my_table (my_field); -- add index on my_field
````
The database will now maintain an index on the `my_field` column, and next requests
can be accelerated by the index.

## Typical index situations

As we have seen in the precedent chapter, the database automatically creates indexes
in some cases, for primary keys, constraints...

### Primary key

When we create tables, we almost always need a primary key, this key will allow
us to find a record in a unique way, and check the record is not null.
In order to check that the primary key is unique, the database will
automatically add an index.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY -- id is our column name, serial is the type.
    -- PRIMARY KEY is a special keyword that creates an index and add a une constraint
);
```

### Unique columns

Like the `PRIMARY KEY` keyword, you can also use the `UNIQUE` keyword, this will
add a constraint of uniqueness, and an index. But donâ€™t ensure not null.
````sql
CREATE TABLE places (
     zip_code int UNIQUE -- The zip code must be unique on this table
);
````
